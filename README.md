## Introduction

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) offers mathematical and computer programming challenges that encourages participants to develop new skills and find enjoyment in the world of mathematics. This project has been a challenging and fun way to demonstrate and practice existing software development skills and learn some new things!

## Progress

This code repository contains functions that produce correct solutions for the following checked problems. The goal is to learn new things and have more fun by adding new solutions over time!

***UPDATE:*** The first 25 problems were complete using JavaScript and Node.js. However, JavaScript has some limitations when dealing with numbers over 21 digits long. So the decision was made to complete problems 26 - 50 using Python wich work out very well. See problem 1 - 25 in JavaScript here [https://github.com/thomaspurk/project-euler-challenges](https://github.com/thomaspurk/project-euler-challenges)
